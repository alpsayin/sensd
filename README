This is collection of software to implement data monitoring and data collection
from WSN Wireless Sensor Networks. The basic idea is to to do a simple, 
straight-forward and robust framework.

Scenario: One or several mots is connected to USB or serial port to gather 
received information from connected WSN motes. Data is stored in ASCII with 
tagging and ID information.


The major components:

 sensd -- A daemon that reads from USB/serial and stores data in a 
          ASCII data file. Usually sensors.dat

 js -- A set Java-scripts can plot, print and visualize sensor data
           from sensd direct in your web-browser.

 seltag -- simple program that can extract data via tags and format 
           output for plottling and further analysis. Ie gnuplot.
