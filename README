Introduction
------------

This is collection of software to implement data monitoring and data collection
from WSN Wireless Sensor Networks. The basic idea is to do a very simple, 
straight-forward and robust framework.

The scenario, One or several mots is connected to USB or serial port to gather 
received information from connected WSN motes. Data is stored in ASCII with 
tagging and ID information. Data is conviently handled, copied and viewed with 
standard text utilties of your OS.

The major components
--------------------

 sensd -- A daemon that reads WSN mote reports from USB/serial and stores 
          data in a ASCII data file. Usually sensors.dat

 js -- A set of Java-scripts can plot, print and visualize sensor data
           from sensd direct in your web-browser.

 seltag -- simple program that can extract data via tags and format 
           output for plottling and further analysis. Ie gnuplot.

 doc -- Documentation and sample files



Sensor data outline
-------------------

Below is and example of an anatomy of sensors.dat we currently using in our WSN 
data collection networks. 

2012-05-22 14:07:46 UT=1337688466 ID=283c0cdd030000d7 PS=0 T=30.56  T_MCU=34.6  V_MCU=3.08 UP=2C15C V_IN=4.66 

2012-05-22 14:11:41 UT=1337688701 ID=28a9d5dc030000af PS=0 T=36.00  V_MCU=2.92 UP=12C8A0 RH=42.0 V_IN=4.13  V_A1=3.43  [ADDR=0.175 SEQ=33 RSSI=21 LQI=255 DRP=1.00]

Each line is a mote report. Starting with date and time followd by a set of
tags. The tags is different for different motes. In other words thay can 
send different data. Essential is the ID which should be unigue for each mote.. 

The information with brackets is information generated by the receiving mote
and is not a part the motes data. Typically RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength
Indicator) and LQI (Link Quality Indicator)

In the example case 

   UT= Unix time
   ID= Unique 64 bit ID
   T= temp in Celcius
   PS= Power Save Indicator
   V_MCU= Microcontorller Voltage
   UP= Uptime (HEX)
   RH= Relative Humidity in %
   V_IN= Voltage Input
   V_A1= Voltage Analog 1 (A1)
